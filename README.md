Before taking over:

- You'll need to set your database (MongoDB).
- Server-Secret is not defined in the code.
- NPM install to get the modules.

*You can read about project arquitecture on file "/docs/notes.txt".*

*To insert an user from zero, set the "dataPreset/userTest.js" file (lines 12 - 13, set your database url on line 6).*
- If you change the permission level lower than 100, you won't be able to see the admin's panel when ussing the app (from there you can add more user accounts).

*You don't need to compile the [front end](https://github.com/Nethanzel/Beacon-front-end-), it is already there!*

*I'll be working on optimize the code.*
